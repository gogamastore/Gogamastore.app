The AI engineer's trajectory details the ongoing development of an Expo React Native e-commerce application. Initially, it involved fixing UI/UX inconsistencies and critical navigation issues, particularly around  for web previews. A major focus was on integrating Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Storage) for core e-commerce functionalities like user management, product display, cart, and complex checkout flows. The engineer iteratively refined payment, order confirmation, and order history screens, including the creation of dynamic tab filters and ensuring accurate Firebase data fetching. Recent efforts concentrated on synchronizing profile data (including photo uploads), implementing robust address management (CRUD operations with proper routing and UI feedback), and optimizing UI elements for mobile (icon sizing, horizontal scrolling). Persistent issues revolved around navigation paths and subtle UI rendering problems, which were meticulously debugged and resolved, showcasing a strong commitment to mobile-first UX and data integrity.

The project aims to create a React Native/Expo mobile application mirroring the  e-commerce website. Key features include user authentication, product browsing, shopping cart management, and user profiles. The initial FastAPI/MongoDB backend was migrated to a Firebase-centric architecture (Authentication, Firestore, Storage), necessitating precise data model alignment and security rules for collections like , , , , , , , and .

Specific feature requests included auto-sliding banners, circular brand icons, in-cart quantity controls, product removal, detailed product views with stock validation, and a comprehensive checkout process. The checkout evolved from mock payment to dynamic bank accounts and COD, with payment proof uploads. Order management (confirmation, history, tracking) was crucial. Recent efforts focused on refining the checkout flow (Bank Transfer/COD only, Buat Pesanan button moved), visually cloning the profile and order history screens from an APK, fixing order history tab layout, synchronizing profile photos, and implementing robust address management.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend**: Expo, React Native, Expo Router (file-based routing), React Navigation, Zustand (state management).
-   **Backend**: Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Storage) as the primary data and auth backend.
-   **Data Management**: Firebase Firestore for all application data, structured in collections and nested documents.
-   **UI/UX**: Flexbox, , ,  for horizontal lists,  for confirmations,  for notifications. Critical use of native React Native components (e.g., ) over web-specific HTML elements.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a monorepo structure with  (FastAPI, largely deprecated) and  (Expo/React Native).



-   ****: Expo configuration, updated for Firebase plugins.
-   ****: Initializes Firebase SDK with platform-specific keys.
-   ****: Centralized Firebase Firestore service. Extensive refactoring for various collections (, , , , , , ), adding methods like , , , , , , , , . Critical fix: changed Firestore collection from  to  for user-related data (addresses, profile info) to match user's Firebase structure. Added address management methods: , , , , .
-   ****: Home screen. Integrated Firebase data, auto-sliding banners, brand directory. Brand directory redesigned for smaller icons and horizontal scrolling using .
-   ****: Shopping cart. Refactored to use nested . Implemented quantity controls and item removal. Crucially,  was used for delete buttons after  with  caused issues. Delete icon size reduced to 18px. Confirmation popup added for item removal.
-   ****: Product detail. Displays product details, quantity selector, Add to Cart button with stock validation.
-   ****: Checkout form. Revised shipping options, removed tax. Order data structure adjusted. Buat Pesanan (Create Order) button integrated directly. Payment method selection (Bank Transfer, COD) now uses dynamic bank account data from Firebase with vertical layout fixed.
-   ****: Payment screen. Simplified and largely bypassed as payment is integrated into .
-   ****: Order history. Displays user's past orders with status tracking. Heavily updated to match APK UI, including filter tabs (Belum Proses, Diproses, etc.) with status counters and professional order cards. Fixed tab menu width consistency to prevent horizontal expansion on empty state and allow horizontal scrolling. The Semua tab was removed. Back button replaced Beranda button.
-   ****: Order confirmation detail. Fixed  to  due to Firebase data structure mismatch. Applied currency formatting for total payment.
-   ****: User profile screen.  for Riwayat Pesanan navigates to . Profile photo display synchronized with Firebase Storage, fetching from . Active order count added, excluding completed, delivered, cancelled statuses. Developer Tools section was removed for production readiness.
-   ****: Root layout. Added  layout.
-   ****: Authentication routes layout.
-   ****: New screen for profile editing (Name, Email, WhatsApp, Photo). Photo upload integrated using Expo ImagePicker to Firebase Storage. Uses  and tracks dirty state.
-   ****: New screen for address management. Displays real addresses from Firebase . Implemented Add, Edit, Delete (with confirmation popup), and Set Default actions. Auto-refreshes on focus. Delete button styling and functionality were fixed, including confirmation popups.
-   ****: New screen for adding addresses. Full form with validation. Connects to . After successful save, displays a toast notification and redirects to . Fixed navigation issues and provided toast notifications.
-   ** (formerly )**: New screen for editing addresses. Dynamic routing  now handles the address ID. Loads existing data, allows updates, and provides a delete option. Fixed routing issues and import paths.
-   ****: Manages user authentication state.

The immediate work involved addressing several critical UI and functional issues reported by the user:

1.  **Order History Tab Menu Visibility & Responsiveness:** The user reported that the status filter tabs (Belum Proses, Diproses, etc.) on the order history page were not visible on mobile or expanded inconsistently when no data was present. The AI engineer previously attempted to fix this by adjusting /, font sizes, and padding in . The Semua tab was removed, and other tabs were given specific widths to fit in one line. The latest iteration confirmed these changes.

2.  **Add Address Page Navigation & Feedback:** The user was getting Unmatched Route errors when navigating to the add address page, and after filling the form, the Save and Back buttons were unresponsive, leaving the user stuck. The AI engineer created  and implemented  (for Android) or  (for iOS/Web) for success notifications, along with an auto-redirect () after successful address addition. The  function was also fixed to use  for reliable navigation. The address list () was updated with  to refresh data upon returning to the screen.

3.  **Edit Address Routing & Delete Functionality:** The user reported an Unmatched Route error when attempting to edit an address, and requested a Delete option on the address list page. The AI engineer created  (later simplified to  due to routing conflicts) to handle dynamic address editing. A direct Delete button was added to each address card in  with confirmation popups and smart logic (e.g., default address cannot be deleted). The routing for edit was changed from  to .

4.  **Delete Button Functionality (Cart & Address):** The user reported that *all* delete buttons (on cart and address list) were unresponsive. The root cause was identified as a hybrid web/mobile code conflict in the cart (using HTML  and ). The AI engineer replaced this with React Native's  and , and ensured consistent  for confirmation popups across both cart and address deletion. Icon sizes were optimized for cart delete button and brand icons.

5.  **Profile Photo & Order Sync:** The user requested synchronization of the profile photo displayed on the main profile screen with the one set in profile settings, and for active order counts to appear on the profile page. The AI engineer implemented fetching  from Firebase for the profile screen and added logic to count active orders (excluding , ,  statuses) from the Firebase orders collection.

The immediate work before this summary request was fixing the  error for the edit address page and ensuring the delete button functionality (with popup confirmations) was working for both cart items and addresses, along with UI optimizations for brand icons and the order history tab menu. The latest issue confirmed by the user was that the delete buttons were still not functioning despite previous fixes, and the brand directory and cart delete icon needed UI adjustments. The AI engineer then proceeded to implement proper  for confirmations, resized the cart delete icon, and redesigned the brand directory for horizontal scrolling.
