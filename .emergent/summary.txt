The AI engineer's trajectory demonstrates an iterative and highly responsive development process, driven by direct user feedback. The journey started with resolving fundamental UI and data integration issues (e.g.,  compatibility, HTML element replacements, image loading, cart logic). A significant portion focused on debugging and refining payment proof upload functionality with Firebase, progressively tackling issues from incorrect  handling to nuanced Firebase Security Rules ( update restrictions). Troubleshooting included re-verifying data schemas, refactoring conditional logic, and implementing detailed logging. Later, the focus shifted to build processes (APK, AAB) and UI/UX improvements like animated splash screens and a major revamp of the homepage and product catalog for better performance and user experience, incorporating pagination and search. Throughout, the AI demonstrated methodical debugging, consistent communication, and a strong adherence to user-specified requirements, frequently confirming changes and offering next steps.

<product_requirements>
The  is an Expo React Native e-commerce mobile application aiming to replicate a website experience. It features user authentication, product browsing, cart management, and profile customization. The backend leverages Firebase for Auth, Firestore, and Storage. Key functionalities include auto-sliding banners, brand directories, in-cart quantity controls, product removal, stock validation, and a comprehensive checkout process with dynamic bank accounts, COD, and payment proof uploads. Order management covers confirmation, history, and tracking. Recent updates focused on displaying accurate order/payment statuses, enabling order cancellation for Pending orders, enhancing payment proof uploads/displays, transforming the Kategori tab to Trending (now Katalog), fixing cart operations, addressing app crashes, replacing  with custom modals, and building an Android APK with a custom GOGAMA logo. The current major revamp involves dedicating the homepage to Trending Products, eliminating category filters, and creating a new Katalog tab for all products with efficient pagination and sorting.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was undertaking a major revamp of the application's homepage and product catalog, following explicit user requests.

**Homepage ():**
The primary task was to change the All Products section to display Trending Products fetched specifically from a Firestore collection named . The category filter section was to be removed, and a Lihat Semua Produk button added to navigate to the full catalog.
-   **Work Done**: The AI has updated  to fetch and render products from . A  service was added/enhanced in  to correctly retrieve these. The category filter UI and related logic have been removed, and the Lihat Semua Produk button's navigation is implemented. Fallback logic was added for cases where  collection might be empty.

**Catalog Page (New  tab, formerly ):**
The existing Trending tab (file , which was renamed to  for the new concept) was to be transformed into a comprehensive Katalog page displaying all products with advanced features.
-   **Work Done**: The file  has been completely rebuilt. It now features:
    -   Pagination logic using  for efficient loading of 100 products per page.
    -    and  are used for smooth Previous and Next navigation.
    -   Client-side sorting ensures available products appear first, then alphabetically.
    -   A real-time search bar has been integrated.
    -   The initialization order error () has been fixed by restructuring the  and  hook usage.

**Current State:**
The AI engineer has completed the code changes for both the homepage trending products display and the advanced catalog pagination/search. The last action was restarting the frontend service (, ) and generating a summary of these latest fixes. The system is now ready for testing these new features.
