The AI engineer's trajectory showcases a complex recovery and development process. Initially, the task was to continue work on a polished Expo app, focusing on homepage and product catalog revamps. However, the conversation quickly pivoted to a critical issue: an unexpected code state after a forked task, where previous rollbacks were not reflected. A significant portion of the work involved a manual rollback to a specific previous version of the homepage and the 'trending' (formerly 'Katalog') page. This was followed by a precise re-implementation of the 'trending' page to correctly display trending products based on explicit user input and then resolving a 'search.tsx' file not found error by creating a new search page. The trajectory concluded with the successful removal of the category filter from the homepage, fulfilling the latest explicit user request. This iterative debugging and refinement process, driven by direct user feedback, highlights robust problem-solving and adaptability to unexpected environmental conditions.

<product_requirements>
The  is an Expo React Native e-commerce mobile application replicating a website experience. It supports user authentication, product browsing, cart management, and profile customization. Key features include auto-sliding banners, brand directories, in-cart quantity controls, stock validation, and a comprehensive checkout process with payment proof uploads (Firebase Storage). Order management covers confirmation, history, and tracking, with recent updates on accurate order/payment statuses and order cancellation for Pending orders. Previous enhancements involved replacing  with custom modals, fixing app crashes, and building Android APK/AAB with custom branding. The initial major revamp aimed to dedicate the homepage to Trending Products and create a new Katalog tab for all products with pagination and search. However, due to rollback issues, the current state shifted: the homepage now displays all products without category filters, and a dedicated Trending tab displays trending products. A new search page has also been implemented.

<code_architecture>


-   ****: Initializes Firebase SDK. No recent changes.
-   ****: Centralized service for Firebase Firestore operations.
    -   **Summary**: Contains various data fetching and manipulation functions for Firestore.
    -   **Changes**:  function was initially added, then removed during rollback, and finally re-added to correctly fetch products from the  collection.  is still present and used for general product display.
-   ****: Home screen.
    -   **Summary**: Displays primary product listings, banners, and brands.
    -   **Changes**: Initially transformed to display trending products and remove category filters. However, due to a rollback request, it was restored to show all products with category filters. Subsequently, the category filter section (imports, states, functions, UI) was completely removed, making it display all products without filtering.
-   ****: Shopping cart screen.
    -   **Summary**: Manages cart items, quantity updates, and removal.
    -   **Changes**: No changes in the provided trajectory. (Original changes involved  replacement and  logic.)

    -   **Summary**: Intended to display trending products.
    -   **Changes**: During rollback,  was deleted and  was created. Initially, the AI made it display categories. Following user correction, it was completely re-implemented to fetch and display actual trending products from the  collection in a 2-column grid with pull-to-refresh and empty states, using the exact code provided by the user.
-   ****: Main app tab layout.
    -   **Summary**: Defines the main tab navigation.
    -   **Changes**: During rollback, the Katalog tab name was changed back to Trending with its corresponding icon.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed a series of critical fixes and feature adjustments stemming from a user-requested rollback and subsequent issues.

The work sequence involved:
1.  **Addressing Rollback Discrepancy**: The user reported that a previous rollback was not fully applied due to the forked task environment. The AI initiated a manual rollback process.
2.  **Homepage Rollback & Refinement ()**: Initially, the homepage was intended to show Trending Products but was rolled back to its prior state (displaying All Products with category filters). Following the very latest user instruction, the AI then successfully removed *all* category filter functionality (imports, states, functions, and UI components) from this page, leaving it to display all products directly.
3.  **Trending Page Re-implementation ()**: After the rollback, the  file (which replaced ) was initially set up incorrectly by the AI to show categories. The user provided explicit code to correct this. The AI then re-implemented  to correctly fetch and display products from the  Firestore collection using  from . It features a 2-column grid, pull-to-refresh, and detailed product display.
4.  ** File Creation ()**: An  error for  was encountered. The AI resolved this by creating a new  file, implementing a full-featured product search page with live search, result display, and consistent UI.
5.  ** Updates**: The  function was re-added/refined in this service to support the corrected  page.
6.  ** Update**: The Katalog tab name was correctly reverted to Trending as part of the rollback.

The application's current state is that the homepage () now displays all products without category filters, the Trending tab () correctly displays trending products from Firestore, and a new  page provides comprehensive product search. All identified errors have been resolved, and the frontend is running.
