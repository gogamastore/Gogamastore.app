The AI engineer's trajectory demonstrates a highly iterative and responsive development process, adapting to shifting requirements and debugging complex issues within a live application context. Initially tasked with revamping existing features, the focus quickly pivoted to addressing critical rollback discrepancies and implementing new functionalities. Key challenges included rectifying unexpected code states, accurately re-implementing core pages based on user-provided code, and resolving persistent UI/navigation bugs. The engineer systematically added new features like a comprehensive top header with notification/cart badges, integrated real-time push notifications via Firebase, introduced a Katalog tab with product search and pagination, and enhanced the checkout flow with an address selector. Continuous debugging loops, often triggered by visual discrepancies or explicit user reports (e.g., layout back tab, address save failure, excessive permissions), highlight a robust problem-solving approach and meticulous attention to detail. The process concluded with the engineer addressing and optimizing application permissions for production builds.

The  is an Expo React Native e-commerce mobile application featuring user authentication, product browsing, cart management, and profile customization. It includes auto-sliding banners, brand directories, in-cart quantity controls, stock validation, and a comprehensive checkout process with Firebase Storage-based payment proof uploads. Order management covers confirmation, history, and tracking, with recent updates on accurate order/payment statuses and order cancellation for Pending orders. Previous enhancements involved replacing  with custom modals, fixing crashes, and building Android APK/AAB with custom branding.

Recent feature additions and modifications include:
- **Homepage**: Displays 200 trending products (fallback to alphabetical if no trending data) with Produk Trending title, and dual Lihat Semua Produk buttons (top and bottom) navigating to the Katalog page, accompanied by a loading warning modal. The search bar has been removed from the homepage.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a critical issue reported by the user regarding an excessive number of Android permissions (32 permissions in version 1.2.0 AAB build, up from 11 in version 1.0.0).

The current work sequence involved:
1.  **Permission Analysis (Chat 464)**: The AI identified that the new permissions were primarily due to the  package, badge functionality for various launchers, and Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) integration.
2.  **Permission Optimization ( edits, Chat 465-477)**:
    *   The AI started by examining  to filter unnecessary permissions.
    *   Added an explicit  array under  to list only required permissions.
    *   Configured the  plugin in  to potentially control permission requests more granularly (, ).
    *   Updated the app  to  and  to  in  to reflect the changes for the new optimized build.
3.  **Initiating Optimized Build (Chat 478)**: The AI was in the process of initiating a new AAB build with the updated configuration, aiming to reduce the number of requested permissions for the Google Play Console submission.

The goal of this immediate work is to provide a cleaner, more secure build with minimal necessary permissions, addressing the user's concern before final deployment.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to initiate the optimized AAB build (version 1.2.1, versionCode 6) with reduced permissions.
