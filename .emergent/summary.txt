The AI engineer's trajectory chronicles an iterative development process for an Expo React Native e-commerce application. Starting with UI/UX fixes and navigation, the core work involved extensive Firebase integration (Auth, Firestore, Storage) for user management, product display, cart, and complex checkout flows. Key achievements include refining payment and order history screens with dynamic filters, synchronizing profile data including photo uploads, and implementing robust address management (CRUD). Recent efforts focused on debugging and resolving persistent issues like non-responsive delete buttons (cart, address), Unmatched Route errors for address editing, and ensuring consistent UI elements. A major phase addressed critical Firebase authentication and configuration mismatches across platforms (Web, Android, iOS), and finally, the engineer tackled user-reported issues on cart item quantity controls, logout functionality, and displaying product names/images/prices on the trending page, demonstrating a continuous cycle of feature implementation, debugging, and refinement based on direct user feedback.

<product_requirements>
The project's objective is to build a React Native/Expo mobile application, , mirroring the  e-commerce website. It must support user authentication, product browsing, cart management, and user profiles. The initial backend was shifted from FastAPI/MongoDB to Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage), requiring precise data model alignment for collections like , , , , and .

Specific functionalities include auto-sliding banners, circular brand icons, in-cart quantity controls, product removal, detailed product views with stock validation, and a comprehensive checkout. The checkout evolved to support dynamic bank accounts and COD, with payment proof uploads. Order management (confirmation, history, tracking) was crucial. Recent user requests focused on:
1. Displaying order status and currency formatting in order confirmation.
2. Implementing order cancellation for Pending orders.
3. Adding a payment proof upload option on the checkout and order confirmation pages.
4. Changing the Kategori tab to Trending and displaying trending products with name and price.
5. Ensuring the Keluar dari Akun (logout) button functions correctly.
6. Fixing cart functionality (add/remove/quantity).

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend**: Expo, React Native, Expo Router (file-based routing), React Navigation.
-   **Backend**: Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Storage) for data persistence and user management.
-   **UI/UX**: Flexbox for layout,  for inputs,  for data refresh,  for horizontal lists,  for confirmations.
-   **Data Management**: Firestore  and , custom  for data operations.

<code_architecture>


-   ****: Initializes Firebase SDK. Crucially updated to ensure correct  (Android vs. Web) and handle platform-specific configurations for consistency across iOS, Android, and Web.
-   ****: Centralized service for Firebase Firestore. Updated extensively to handle order cancellation logic (), improved  to return an object with an  array, and enhanced error handling.
-   ****: Home screen. Integration of Firebase data, auto-sliding banners, and brand directory.
-   ****: Shopping cart. Refactored to correctly process  array for total calculation and item display. Implemented ,  with confirmation popups using , and fixed  usage for buttons. This file was significantly restored due to user-reported data structure issues and non-functional buttons.
-   ****: Product detail screen.
-   ****: Checkout form. Modified to include a payment proof upload section with an explicit Unggah (Upload) button, leveraging  and .
-   ****: Order history. Updated to allow order cancellation for pending orders directly from the order card with confirmation. Currency formatting was also applied for consistency.
-   ****: Order confirmation detail. Enhanced to display order status using  and , added Batalkan Pesanan (Cancel Order) button for pending orders, and integrated a payment proof upload section with an explicit Unggah button, displayed for all statuses except selesai (completed). Currency formatting for total payment was also implemented.
-   ****: User profile. The Keluar dari Akun (logout) button was debugged and confirmed to function, including navigation to the login screen. Profile photo and active order counts were previously synchronized.
-   ****: Root layout.
-   ****: Login screen. Critical debugging and fixes for Firebase authentication, including API key consistency, enhanced error handling, and the removal of development/testing buttons and credentials for production readiness.
-   ****: Authentication routes layout.
-   ****: Profile editing.
-   ****: Address management.
-   ****: Add address form.
-   ****: Edit address form.
-   ****: Manages user authentication. Updated with better error handling, logging, and a timeout fallback for persistent loading states. Logout functionality was also refined for reliable navigation.
-   ** (formerly )**: New screen for trending products. Modified to fetch  from Firebase, display product names and correctly format prices, and ensure product images are rendered.
-   ****: Expo configuration. Updated for Firebase plugins and later cleaned to remove unused  plugin.
-   ****: New file for EAS Build configuration, created in preparation for APK builds.
-   ****: Android Firebase config, verified for correctness.
-   ****: iOS Firebase config, critical  was corrected multiple times to ensure consistency with Android/Web and then reverted to its original iOS-specific value per user request.

<pending_tasks>
-   Implementing Push notifications for order updates.
-   Developing Advanced order tracking with delivery estimates.
-   Implementing Order cancellation and refund flows (partial implementation done for pending orders).
-   Building an Admin dashboard for order management.
-   Creating an APK file for the application (paused after testing/development buttons removal).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing several critical user-reported issues on the frontend:

1.  **Cart Functionality (Tambah/Kurang/Hapus Item):** The user reported that the quantity controls (/) and the delete button in the cart were non-functional, and numerical input for quantity was not working. The AI engineer diagnosed that the  and  functions in  were not refreshing the cart data after updates. The core issue was identified as  because  returned an object with an  array, not the array directly. The  file was extensively refactored to correctly access , re-implement quantity controls (, ) and ensure  correctly calls the updated  logic. Logging was added for debugging.

2.  **Logout Button on Profile Page:** The Keluar dari Akun (logout) button on  was reported as non-functional. The AI engineer verified the  function in  and the  function in . The issue was likely related to navigation after logout or the authentication state not being cleared properly. Logging was added to 's  function to confirm navigation to  (login screen).

3.  **Trending Page Product Image Display:** The user noted that product images were not appearing on the Trending page (), despite being visible on the home screen. The AI engineer checked the  function and the data fetching logic. It was identified that  might be missing or malformed in the fetched  data. Debugging logs were added to  to inspect the  structure.

The AI engineer applied fixes to all these areas, including code refactoring, adding  for confirmations, and debugging data flow, and summarized these fixes in Chat Message 510. The frontend was restarted after each major set of changes.
