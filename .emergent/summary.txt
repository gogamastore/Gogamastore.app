The AI engineer's trajectory showcases an iterative development process driven by direct user feedback and detailed debugging. Initially, the AI struggled with environmental access and misdiagnosed UI issues, believing the code was correct when, in fact,  compatibility and data structure mismatches were causing problems. A turning point was the user providing specific console logs, which enabled the AI to accurately pinpoint and fix issues like undefined product IDs in the cart and missing image data on the trending page.

Later, the focus shifted to APK builds, where the AI demonstrated strong troubleshooting by using a dedicated agent to identify and resolve critical crashes caused by embedded HTML elements and inefficient data loading. The process involved extensive component replacement, UI refactoring, and Firebase integration enhancements, including a comprehensive payment proof system and dynamic order status displays. Despite occasional build failures and queue limits, the AI persistently corrected issues and diligently applied user-requested features, always confirming the state of fixes. The final interaction highlights a key handoff in control over the build process, signaling a refined workflow based on user preference.

The  project aims to replicate an e-commerce website as an Expo React Native mobile application. Core functionalities include user authentication, product browsing, cart management, and profile customization. The backend transitioned from FastAPI/MongoDB to Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage), necessitating strict data model alignment for collections like , , , , and .

Key features implemented include auto-sliding banners, brand directories, in-cart quantity controls (including direct numerical input), product removal, stock validation, and a comprehensive checkout process supporting dynamic bank accounts and COD, with payment proof uploads. Order management, encompassing confirmation, history, and tracking, was crucial. Recent development focused on:
1. Displaying order status, currency formatting, and an order cancellation option for Pending orders.
2. Implementing payment proof upload on both checkout and order confirmation pages, with a visual display of the uploaded proof.
3. Changing the Kategori tab to Trending to display trending products with images, names, and prices.
4. Ensuring correct functionality of cart operations (add/remove/quantity controls).
5. Fixing the Keluar dari Akun (logout) button.
6. Addressing app crashes during navigation (product detail, checkout) and slow loading times.
7. Fixing  compatibility issues by replacing them with custom modals.
8. Building an Android APK with the custom GOGAMA logo.

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing the user's report that the Unggah Bukti Pembayaran (Upload Payment Proof) button and the display of the uploaded proof were not appearing correctly on the Order Confirmation page, especially based on . The user explicitly stated that the button should appear if  is Pending and the uploaded image should show if  is paid or confirmed.

The AI engineer's actions involved:
1.  **Debugging **: The AI initially tried to locate the Enhanced Payment Proof Section but determined it was either missing or incorrectly merged in previous edits.
2.  **Restoring **: The complete payment proof component logic, including conditional display for the upload interface (if  is pending/undefined/empty) and the image preview (if  exists), was re-added to .
3.  **Refining Conditional Logic**: The display logic was made more robust to handle cases where  might be , , or an empty string, treating these as pending states to ensure the upload option appears.
4.  **Confirming  Schema**: The AI re-verified that  correctly sets  as a default for new orders, ensuring the base data for the new logic is in place.
5.  **Enhanced Debug Logging**: Additional console logs () were added to  to output the exact  value and the conditions being evaluated, aiding in future debugging.

After these code changes, the AI initiated a new APK build () to apply the fixes. The previous build () had just finished successfully before the new fixes were applied. The latest build was in progress and then the user issued the instruction to stop automatically creating APKs.

Based on the user's latest instruction sobat tunggu perintahku lain kali jika ingin membuat apk, nanti di saat saya minta saja, the next step is to wait for the user's explicit command for any further APK builds or development tasks.
