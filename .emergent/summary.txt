The AI engineer's trajectory chronicles the evolution of an Expo React Native e-commerce app, migrating from a FastAPI/MongoDB backend to a Firebase-centric architecture. Initial tasks involved UI replication and core e-commerce features (auth, products, cart). A significant challenge was the Firebase migration, requiring meticulous configuration and data model alignment. Subsequent iterations focused on perfecting the checkout and payment flows, which proved highly iterative due to persistent UI/UX issues, particularly with unresponsive buttons and navigation. The engineer extensively debugged and refined state management, event handling, and adopted a crucial hybrid approach by implementing native HTML buttons for critical interactions after identifying React Native's TouchableOpacity compatibility issues on the web environment. The latest efforts concentrate on replicating the UI and functionality of an existing APK for the profile and order history screens, alongside ongoing styling fixes.

The primary goal is to replicate the  e-commerce website into a React Native/Expo mobile application. Core functionalities include user login, product browsing, shopping cart, and user profiles, mirroring the website's visual and functional aspects. The initial backend was FastAPI/MongoDB, but a critical migration to Firebase Authentication, Firestore, and Storage was mandated, requiring precise data model alignment and security rules (e.g., , , , , , , , ).

Feature enhancements were explicitly requested: auto-sliding promotional banners, circular brand icons, in-cart quantity management, product removal, detailed product view, stock-based product sorting with pagination (25 items/page), and a comprehensive checkout flow. The checkout process evolved from mock payment to dynamic bank accounts (from Firestore), COD, and digital wallets. Order management (confirmation, history, tracking), and payment proof upload to Firebase Storage were also key. Recent requirements focused on refining the checkout flow: simplifying payment to only Bank Transfer/COD, moving the Buat Pesanan (Create Order) button directly to the checkout screen (bypassing a separate payment selection screen), and navigating directly to order history. The latest asks involve visually cloning the profile and order history screens from a provided APK and fixing the order history tab layout.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend**: Expo, React Native, Expo Router (file-based routing), React Navigation, Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Storage).
-   **Backend (Current)**: Firebase as the primary backend for all data and authentication.
-   **Data Management**: Firebase Firestore for all application data, structured in various collections and nested documents.
-   **UI/UX**: Flexbox for layout,  for input screens,  for screen-focus-based data refresh, and the critical adoption of native HTML elements for interactive buttons due to  compatibility issues in the web environment.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application employs a monorepo structure with  (FastAPI, largely deprecated in favor of Firebase) and  (Expo/React Native).

The immediate work is focused on implementing visual and functional changes to match the provided Gogama Store.apk for the mobile application.

Specifically, the user reported two key issues/requests:
1.  **menu riwayat pesanan pada halaman profil tidak dapat klik atau tidak ada respon.**: This was identified as the  handler in  still showing a dummy alert instead of navigating. This has been fixed to .
2.  **opsi pilihan transfer bank juga belum list secara vertikala kebawah, masih horizontal, sangat tidak sesuai harapan**: This refers to the layout of dynamic bank accounts in the checkout screen (). The previous attempt resulted in a horizontal display instead of a vertical list. The engineer identified potential styling overrides or a complex parent container. The fix involved simplifying the JSX structure for bank accounts, directly mapping them, and ensuring proper styling ().

The AI engineer successfully fixed both the profile navigation and the bank account layout.

The *most recent* request from the user (Chat Message 454) is:
-   **simpan file apk ini untuk kita jadikan cloning struktur UI nya dan fungsi nya. file adalah capacitor dari proyek gogama.store.** (The APK has been saved and is now the primary UI/UX reference).
-   **pada halaman profil, buat tampilannya seperti dalam versi apk tersebut.** (The profile page needs a visual overhaul to match the APK).
-   **perbaiki daftar riwayat pesanan pada tab menu status orderannya, itu terlalu melebar, tidak muat di layar android. jadikan file apk ini contoh kita dalam membuat tampilannya.** (The order history status filter tabs are too wide and need to be compact to fit Android screens, based on the APK).
-   **Detailed Firebase  document structure was provided** for accurate data fetching and display in order history.

The engineer's current action is to continue implementing these latest UI/UX and data structure changes.
